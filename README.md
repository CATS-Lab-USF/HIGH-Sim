Due to the limited upload size for each file of GitHub, we uploaded the first 90 trajectories for illustration purpose. The whole dataset is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HfMokgtkqi44t_khkdAB7QjnBqh_J7mx?usp=sharing (about 1GB).

Some MATLAB codes that may help you to process the dataset can be found in the trajectory illustration package. Also, several plots of the first 90 trajectories can be found there. If you feel the dataset helps your research, please cite our two research papers related to this dataset as follows.
